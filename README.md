# My Garmin Watch Face
This repository contains a custom watchface designed in MonkeyC for Garmin Forerunner 265S.

Included in the repository are images showcasing the watchface in different modes:

## Description
The watchface is crafted to offer a perfect blend of functionality, minimalist aesthetics, and beauty. Drawing inspiration from Google design language and typography, it presents a clean and elegant display on your Garmin watch.

## Usage

To load the watch face onto your 265S, load the [PRG file](My-Garmin-Watch-Face/SuperSimple/export/v2/SuperSimple-v2.prg) into the Apps folder of your 265S when it is plugged into your PC.

To edit or modify the watch face, the main file of the watch face is the [SuperSimpleView.mc](My-Garmin-Watch-Face/SuperSimple\source\SuperSimpleView.mc) in the "source" folder. You must then build and export a new PRG file to load onto your 265S.


## Features
Functional Design: Prioritizing utility, the watchface ensures all essential information is easily accessible at a glance.
Battery Efficiency: Engineered to optimize battery consumption, sacrificing no functionality from a traditional watch.

## Prerequisites
Before installing and using this custom watchface, ensure you have the Garmin Connect IQ SDK installed on your development environment. You can download the SDK from [Garmin Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/overview/).
